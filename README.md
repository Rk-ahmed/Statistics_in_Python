# Descriptive Statistics in Python

## What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is a branch of mathematics concerned with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data.  
There are two primary types of statistics:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize and describe features of a dataset.  
2. **Inferential Statistics**: Make inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample.

In this project, we focus on **Descriptive Statistics** and demonstrate how to use Python libraries to calculate and visualize statistical measures.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

1. **pandas**  
   - Used for data manipulation and analysis.  
   - Example use: Loading datasets, performing data transformations.

2. **scipy.stats.trim_mean**  
   - Used for calculating the trimmed mean, which removes a specified proportion of outliers from a dataset.

3. **numpy**  
   - Provides support for mathematical operations on arrays and matrices.  
   - Commonly used for numerical computing.

4. **matplotlib.pyplot**  
   - A popular plotting library used for data visualization.  
   - Example use: Plotting graphs and charts.

5. **seaborn**  
   - Built on top of `matplotlib`, used for statistical data visualization.  
   - Provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
